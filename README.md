## Bug report

## Refactoring, code standards

We used refactoring to rename variables and function names as suggestive as possible.

## Comments

We used many comments in this project to clearly explain the implementation.This makes it easy for you to understand the code. 

## Design patterns

## GitHub Copilot/chatGPT

We used chatGPT to correctly position the messages on the page.Furthermore, We used it to generate the message sorting function and many other functions.
